I'm addied up, added up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my show's so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though…
My flight too private, my show's so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though…
